# PalmMind AI Chatbot

A conversational AI assistant for PalmMind Technology that answers company questions and handles appointment bookings.

## What This Does

Built a chatbot that acts like a company representative. It can:
- Answer questions about PalmMind's services, team, and achievements 
- Collect user contact info when they want to talk to the team
- Book appointments with smart date parsing ("tomorrow" â†’ "2025-05-26")
- Save everything to files for the company to follow up

## How I Got The Data

Scraped all the content from PalmMind's website - their services, testimonials, company info, etc. Put it all in markdown files organized by category. The bot reads these files to answer questions about the company.

## Project Structure

```
â”œâ”€â”€ server.py              # MCP server with appointment/contact tools
â”œâ”€â”€ client.py              # Main chatbot that connects everything
â”œâ”€â”€ server_config.json     # MCP server configuration  
â”œâ”€â”€ palmmind_resources/    # Scraped company data
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ company/          # About, mission, achievements
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ services/         # AI services they offer
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ testimonials/     # Client testimonials
â””â”€â”€ user_info/            # Generated contact & appointment files
```

## The Architecture 

**Server** (`server.py`): Handles the conversational tools using MCP (Model Context Protocol). Has two main tools:
- `collect_contact_info` - Gets name, phone, email through conversation
- `book_appointment` - Handles appointment booking with date parsing

**Client** (`client.py`): The main chatbot that connects to Claude AI and the MCP servers. Handles document search, file reading, and tool execution.

## Tools Breakdown

**Document Tools** (built-in MCP):
- `search_files` - Finds relevant company files 
- `read_file` - Reads the content to answer questions
- `list_directory` - Explores the file structure

**Custom Tools**:
- `collect_contact_info` - Multi-step conversation to get user details
- `book_appointment` - Books appointments with natural language date parsing

## Smart Features

- **Date Intelligence**: "tomorrow", "next Monday", "May 30th" â†’ proper YYYY-MM-DD format
- **Shared Sessions**: Remembers user name across tools (no asking twice)
- **Input Validation**: Checks email format, phone numbers, prevents past dates
- **Conversational Flow**: Step-by-step dialogs that feel natural
